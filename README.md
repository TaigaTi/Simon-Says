# Simon Says
Simon Says is a modern twist on the classic memory game which challenges players to remember and replicate sequences of colors and sounds that grow longer and more complex with each turn. 

With each round, the game randomly selects a color in the sequence, and players must repeat the entire pattern correctly to earn points!
